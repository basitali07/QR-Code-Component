## My process


First I write HTML code, like i created one main section in which i created a div inside that div i created two sections, one for image and one for text.
And after writing HTML code successfully i wrote CSS code for this project.


### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Box-Model

### What I learned

I learned alot of things during this challenge but at the some part of code i face some difficulty to align the h1 element and p element....

```html
<section class="text">
            <h1>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
            <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
          </section>
```
```css
.text{
    text-align: center;
    padding: 0 25px;
}
h1{
    color: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
    font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
    font-size: 22px;
    font-weight: 700;
    padding: 20px 0;
